# interestNook

Description:  The project will be an event app where you can post an event which features a location and a description.  The event can be liked by other users and commented.  A bonus feature may be to RSVP to such events.  There will be a page to update events, read events, and even to search for events(either based on title or location).  There will be a page to comment on a post as well!  A bonus feature may be to have a calendar API to show events or RSVP to them.
